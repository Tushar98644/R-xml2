# Introduction

The xml2 package in R provides a powerful set of tools for parsing and working with XML and HTML content. This repository aims to provide comprehensive tests and examples to help users understand and leverage the capabilities of the xml2 package.

# Tests Overview

This repository contains three tests:

`Easy Test`: This test demonstrates basic XML parsing using the xml2 package. It involves extracting specific information from a simple XML document.

`Medium Test`: The medium test builds upon the concepts covered in the easy test and introduces more advanced XML parsing techniques. It involves replicating a given analysis using functions from the XML package.

`Hard Test`: The hard test is the most challenging and requires advanced XML parsing skills. It involves writing a custom function to parse XML code without depending on the XML package.

Each test is designed to progressively increase in difficulty, providing users with a comprehensive learning experience.
